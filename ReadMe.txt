Thanks to Brooks Riggio for Deck and Card constructors and the shuffle function as well.

The page is up on gh-pages, but for some reason the Skeleton, my boilerplate, isn't being recognized. So, it's not a great representation.

This page is meant to represent what I've learned from studying and writing html, css, javascript, and jquery.

This was a great project, mostly because I was able to successfully put in code what I had in my mind.

Writing the Insertion sort in jquery was definitely the most difficult part.

I'd guess I put in at least 10 hours on the project, those hours flew by though.
